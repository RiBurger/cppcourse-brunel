/**
 * \brief This Network class makes it easier to simulate the states and
 * interactions of a group of neurons. 
 * 
 * Its default constructor creates the neurons, and then functions are 
 * available to link the neurons, and thus making them interact, to add 
 * a current to the Network, and finally to run the whole simulation 
 * (and write the time of spikes in a file to be able to create a plot).
